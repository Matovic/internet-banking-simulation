# Trustworthy Software
School project from course Object-Oriented Programming in second bachelor semester. General topic for class 2019/2020 - Trustworthy Software.

Main criteria:   
- [x] The program must work and correspond to the project assignment approved by the teacher and to principal teacher's requirements that occurred during the project realization.
- [x] The submitted source code must include all necessary files and it must be possible to compile it in the Eclipse environment installed in the laboratory where the exercises are held. 
- [x] The program must embrace a meaningful inheritance between own classes and overriding of own methods. 
- [x] Encapsulation has to be employed in the program. 
- [x] The program must embrace sufficient comments to understand the code.
- [x] The documentation must correspond to the program and it must contain a class diagram. 
- [x] A student has to be capable of answering all the teacher's questions regarding the project during the final presentation. 
- [x] Application of object-oriented mechanisms in the program (an appropriate use of inheritance, encapsulation, and aggregation), code organization, and documentation quality. 

Further criteria:  
- [x] application of design patterns except the Singleton design pattern – each design pattern implemented counts as a fulfillment of one further criterion, but the implementation of all design patterns is assessed as a fulfillment of three further criteria at most:  
     - [x] Observer  
     - [x] Builder  
     - [x] Factory 
- [x] handling exceptional states using own exceptions – one exception is sufficient, but it has to be actually thrown and handled   
- [x] providing a graphical user interface separated from application logic and with at least part of the event handlers created manually – counts as a fulfillment of two further criteria 
- [x] using nested classes and interfaces – only using them within the application logic counts, not in the GUI, whereby the interfaces have to be own (one possibility is present in the inner class example provided with lecture 4)  
- [x] using lambda expressions or method references – only using them within the application logic counts, not in the GUI, whereby the interfaces have to be own (one possibility is present in the method reference and lambda expression example provided with lecture 4)  
- [x] using default method implementation in interfaces 
Launch Main.java in jdk1.8.0_241 version.
